			<div class="faqHeader"><h3>Membership</h3></div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>How do I become a member?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				Attend meetings which are held every Monday from 5-6pm. You must provide your first and last name along with a valid UCI e-mail address. 
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>Is there a fee to pay to become a member?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				Membership is free! However, we do require members to wear our shirts($10) during events to show our teamwork as an organized group. 
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>Are there any requirements to be a member?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				Because we do not require a membership fee, we base our members on a point system to become an active member. The amount of points varies from quarter to quarter. Check the "Requirements" page under the "Member Info" tab for more information. Deadline to earn your points is the end of week 9. Within those points, members need to attend at least 2 weekend events and perform at least 2 hours of fundraising. 
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>What is the benefit of becoming an active member?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				If you are an active member for at least 2 quarters, you are eligible to apply for board positions which take place during Spring. Active members are also rewarded a certificate during week 10 of each quarter. (Please e-mail our Secretary if you are unable to redeem your certificate at that time.) 
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>I didn't join at the beginning of the quarter. Is it too late to join? Should I wait until next quarter?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				It is NEVER too late to join our club. We welcome new members any time.
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>What if I can't be an active member this quarter? Will I be removed from the club?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				Whether you're an active member or not, we will never kick anyone out of the club. We provide fun ice breakers and socials so you can meet people who share similar interest. At the least, everyone will agree that being a part of the community is amazing! Please let us know if you plan to stay for company to allow other members to go to events for points. 
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>Who can I talk to about my membership points? Where can I view the points?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				You can also view your points on our website. Give us some time to update points after each event and if you need to talk to us about points via email or any board member.

			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>Do I have to donate blood to be part of the club?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				Although our club is the Red Cross Club, we don't require members to donate blood if they don't feel comfortable doing so. We still have many other opportunities to volunteer. 
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>What if I forget to wear my RCC shirt?

				<span class="right arrow"></span>Do I have to go to the meetings to be a member? What if I can't attend meetings?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				You don't have to go to meetings to become a member; however, priority to sign up for events and fundraisers go to those who attend meetings along with important announcements. Things covered at meetings will usually be sent out in weekly emails and posted on this website.
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>How can I contact the club?

			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>How do I get myself added to the waitlist for weekend events?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				Send us an email, clearly indicating your name, phone number, email, and whether you can drive or not. Title the subject line with the name of the event. Do this as soon as you can. If you can drive, please indicate the number of passengers you can drive. 
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>What if I signed up for an event and can no longer attend?
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<span class="right arrow"></span>We expect members to inform us 24 hours prior to the event if they are not able to attend. Failure to not inform us will result in members losing 10 points because itâ€™s a lost opportunity for members who were on the waitlist to attend the events. If you are a new member and decide to drop the event, you MUST contact us so your spot can be given to another general member. Our event coordinators work tirelessly to find events for us and the organizations we work for are dependant on volunteers such as us.
