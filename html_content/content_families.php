		<h4>The year-long family system has been established in order to provide a welcoming
		and comfortable environment for new members and to strengthen the bonds between RCC members. It helps make it easier for members to meet each other and to build close friendships via family socials and gatherings while also providing organization and structure for board members to keep track of the current members. Below are this year's families. If you have recently joined the club, please email us ASAP with your family preference and we'll place you in one of our amazing families.<br><br>
