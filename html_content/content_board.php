				Hey Everyone, Connie here, your co-president chair and total FOODIE. I look forward to meeting you all. You'll usually find me streaming Youtube, going on spontaneous food runs with people, or just simply being my dorky self. I've never regretted my decision on joining RCC my freshman year and being part of the RCC family, Yes, family, because I feel at home with this club as I can run fun socials for a day and serve in my community less than 24 hours later. I hope you all can be part of this great big family too. Feel free to say “Hi”, hang out with me, tell me about your day. I swear I won’t bite, unless you magically turn into a juicy piece of KBBQ. xD

					Things are constantly moving in a quarter system, but one constant for me has always been RCC. I joined RCC during my freshman year to get more involved with community service and was amazed by all the opportunities, friendships, and memories this club has given me. It's now my 3rd year with RCC and I know together we'll create more memories here at UCI. I look forward to getting to know everyone!

					When I began my first year I looked everywhere for a club to satisfy my desire for community service and community itself. I tried numerous clubs but the one that I loved the most was RCC. With RCC I found myself as a altruist and found an undeniable sense of connection with my community. Ever since joining, I've made countless friends that also share my passion for community service, and I expect no less from future members.

					To me, RCC is more than just a community service organization. Not only was I able to partake in numerous events as I did back in my hometown, but furthermore I was able to socialize more within the club. Bringing people together who work for the same goal in helping our society was a great experience, especially with making new friends through meetings, socials, fundraising and campus events. I am very excited to be a part of Red Cross in representing the club itself. I hope I can bring people together in making friends while focusing on the main purpose in helping our community to the fullest. Aside from RCC, I take passion in playing the Piano and Art.

					Walking into my first RCC meeting, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was open and excited for new experiences. I ended up really loving the club, and everything it had to offer from the community service, to the family system, and the friendships made. I think it's great that we as a club, and individuals are able to give back to the community. Both the local, and community at large.  Feel free to get to know me! Some things you should know are that I'm a fan of video games, doctor who, sci-fi, hanging out, and everything haha. I hope you all enjoy your time here at UCI, and I hope Red Cross Club is something that is able to impact you both positively and strongly.

					<p>Hey everyone~ I am so excited for what this year has to offer with ya’ll and I can’t wait to meet everyone. I have been a part of RCC ever since my first year at UCI and I continue coming back for the welcoming vibes and the great volunteering opportunities! Some things about myself: I love watching YouTube videos, sew cute clothing from scratch or up-cycling my old wardrobe with my trusty old sewing machine and, believe it or not… studying. I am also fond of dogs, anime and kpop. If you have any questions, need someone to talk to or want a study buddy, don’t be afraid to ask me!</p>

						Hey everyone! My name’s Crisia (pronounced like Tricia but with a C). Being a part of RCC was a very enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Not only did it help me give back to the community but it also introduced me to a lot of people. A few things about me, I am a dog-lover. I am also interested in fashion, movies and kpop. I would love to talk to you about the latest trends and your biases but most importantly, don’t hesitate to talk to me about anything at all. I love learning about new things! And if you happen to have a dog, I wouldn’t mind it if you bring them to the club meetings. In fact, I’ll love you forever. (granted I already love y’all for joining Red Cross)

						If you are reading this, then you must be somewhat interested in volunteering or joining RCC. Well whatever the reason, I welcome you! I want to start off by stating that volunteering has always been a passion of mine! Helping others and setting an example of being "the change" I want to see in the world. With a helping hand, a kind heart, and a warm smile it can make people's days or even change their lives. My aspiration in life is to create a combine facility that takes care of both senior citizens and children. If you want to know more then you just have to talk to me.

						Hi! My name is Vonnie. I’m a 4th year Bio Sci major. I was pre-med but plan to go to vet school instead which means I love animals. Other things I enjoy doing is eating, watching tv shows and movies, hanging with friends, and hopefully hitting the gym. If anyone wants a gym buddy or if you just want a buddy to hang with, hit me up. Red Cross has given me lots of memories and hopefully you guys will make lots of great memories too. I look forwards to sharing many more memories with everyone.

					It's Thanh (pronounced like Tawn) and I'm excited to be a part of what RCC has to offer this year. I joined RCC last year, and ever since then, I have nothing but positive things to say. The club brings a profound sense of job upon knowing that each and every person contributes to help improve our local and global communites. Community service is something I strongly believe in, and with RCC it has enabled me to not only give back, but to get to meet amazing people along the way. Asides from the club, I have a wide variety of interest. They are, but not limited to, video games, sports, movies, lots of TV shows, anything DC Comics related, and food. If you ever see me around, feel free to say hi!
