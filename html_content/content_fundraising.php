			<h4>Please Note</h4>
			<p>
			<span class="right arrow"></span>We will be selling delicious Korean BBQ tacos (2 for $3, 4 for $5) as well as skewers and fruit cups. Stay tuned to find out what we're selling on which dates!<br>
			<span class="right arrow"></span>To achieve active member status, general members are required to complete 2 hours of fundraising every quarter. Members will receive 2.5 points for every hour that they fundraise.<br>
			<span class="right arrow"></span>Cashbox is to be handled by <span style="color: red">only board members</span>.<br> 
   			<span class="right arrow"></span>Attending poster-making sessions will not count towards fundraising hours.<br>
   			<span class="right arrow"></span>For future reference, blood drives will count towards fundraising, but are not included in CDV fundraising hours.<br>
   			<span class="right arrow"></span>If you are attending CDV, it is appreciated if you can help us reach our monetary goal, which will be donated to to children.<br>
   			<span class="right arrow"></span>Please check the Facebook page frequently in case of any cancelations, especially on potentially rainy days.

			<h4>Guidelines</h4>
			<p>
			General members are expected to be familiar with the following guidelines. Knowing these things will not only speed up the process, but also improve the club's sales.<br></p>
			<p>
   			<span class="right arrow"></span>Gloves are <span style="color: red"> REQUIRED </span>for food handling. Our permit will be revoked if this rule is not followed.<br>
   			<span class="right arrow"></span>We own a fire extinguisher in case of any emergencies. It is in the plastic bin with the rest of the supplies. Remember <span style="color: red">P.A.S.S</span> (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep). The first aid kit is also located in the plastic bin.<br>
   			<span class="right arrow"></span>Members with long hair: please tie your hair up. It prevents hair from falling into the food and tables where we make the food.<br>
   			<span class="right arrow"></span>Be wary of surrounding people to avoid accidents or spills
   			</p>
